            <h1>
                What kind of program should I apply for? Bachelor’s, master’s, PhD?
            </h1>
            <p>
                If you are about to finish school, you can try entering a BA program (the first stage of higher
                education).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you already have a bachelor's degree, you can go for a master's program, with an opportunity of
                changing your field if you want to. Thus, with a BA in psychology, you can take up a master's course in
                Economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a specialist's degree (higher professional education in some countries, ranked between BA
                and MA), you can go for master's, MBA, or even PhD.
            </p>
            <h1>
                What exams do I need to take in order to enter a US university?
            </h1>
            <p>
                It is mandatory to take TOEFL, the internationally acclaimed test of English. If you're applying for a
                bachelor's course, you will also need to take SAT, if it's a master's course, then GRE, and those who
                seek enrollment on master's programs in Economics will have to take a GMAT.
            </p>
            <h1>
                When should I start preparing?
            </h1>
            <p>
                At least a year, preferably two years before the course start date. We also work with guys and girls who
                plan to get down to their studies in just a few months, but the choice of establishments in this event
                is considerably narrower.
            </p>
            <h1>
                What papers do I need to prepare for enrollment?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Requirement may vary in different universities and faculties, but in most cases you will need:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>exam scores (TOEFL, SAT/GMAT/GRE)</li>
                <li>a copy of your school certificate and/or higher education diploma</li>
                <li>two motivation letters</li>
                <li>two letters of reference</li>
                <li>a filled-in university application form</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>
                I haven't yet obtained my certificate/diploma, can I apply?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Yes, you can, but you will need to submit your current academic record and send your certificate/diploma
                later, as soon as you get it.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Do I stand an actual chance of getting a scholarship for my studies?
            </h1>
            <p>
                If you have a high average score and a few nice-looking achievements (such as academic contests and
                publications), you are quite likely to get funding. The most important thing is to choose the right
                universities and file all the papers in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realize that you might still have a lot of questions. If you are still unsure whether studying in the
                USA is right for you, we can discuss your personal circumstances at a consultation and draft a list of
                steps that could be made as early as tomorrow, a list of papers you should start collecting, and exams
                you could start preparing for.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are positive that an American education is the only way for you to achieve your life goals, we'll
                be thrilled to help you make your dream come true.

                What universities do we work with?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Each and every accredited university. Our selection of universities is not influenced by the commission
                we can get from them (which is quite typical of most foreign education agents). Instead, it is based
                exclusively on your needs and requirements.
